                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">1.1 We are Kartoa Technologies Ltd, registered in England and Wales with company number 13631421 and registered address at 2nd Floor, Howard House, St Johns Walk, Bedford, England, MK42 0DJ. Any reference to “Wooqlaw” or “us” is a reference to Kartoa Technologies Ltd. If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms or about the services we provide, please email us at help@wooqlaw.com.</p>

                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">1.2 We operate an online platform available at www.wooqlaw.com as well as through the associated mobile apps (the “Platform”). Through the Platform we enable users or clients (“Clients” or “you”) to search for and connect with qualified legal practitioners, and to submit enquiries to individual lawyers or law firms (“Enquiries”).</p>

                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">1.3 These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your use of the Platform as a Client, as well as your use of any services we may provide through or in connection with the Platform (“Services”). Your use of our mobile app is governed by our Mobile Application End-User Licence Agreement. Our practices on personal data processing and the use of cookies are set out in our Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy, respectively. These documents are incorporated into, form a part of, and should be read alongside these Terms.</p>

                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">1.4 Your attention is specifically drawn to sections 5 (Billing and Payment), 6 (Suspension, Cancellation and Termination) and 8 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnity) of these Terms.</p>

                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">1.5 We may amend these Terms and we will notify you of any changes by email. These changes will apply from the date mentioned in the email. If any of the changes are material in nature and adversely affect the Services you receive from us, you will have a period of 7 days from the notification date of such changes to cancel your contract with us, including any subscription. In such circumstances you will be entitled to a prorated refund of any fees you have already paid to us from the date of termination until your next Subscription Renewal Date (as defined below). If you continue to use the Platform after this date, you will be deemed to have accepted the respective amendments.</p>

                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">2.1 Before you sign up to our Platform, you are encouraged to read these Terms. By agreeing to use the Platform in accordance with the subscription plan and its term specified in your user account or using any part of our Services (your “Subscription”), and in consideration of payment of any charges or fees for our Services (“Charges”) in accordance with these Terms, you enter into a contract with us (the “Contract”). If you enter into the Contract on behalf of a company you confirm that you have the authority to legally bind that company and you accept these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, we may not allow you to use the Platform and our Services.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">2.2 The functionality of the Platform and the Services we provide to you depend on the Subscription you have with us. When you sign up to our Platform, you will be able to select a subscription plan. When your Subscription is activated, you can interact with the Platform, submit Enquiries and use the consultation technology services provided as part of your Subscription.</p>

                        <p class="text-xs md:text-sm font-normal text-gray-600">2.3 Your Subscription will start on a date we agree. This date will be shown in your user account and will be referred to as your “Subscription Start Date”. Your Subscription will generally renew automatically on each monthly or annual anniversary of your Subscription Start Date, as we agree; every such anniversary will be referred to as your “Subscription Renewal Date”. Your Subscription shall continue until terminated in accordance with these Terms.</p>

Where this is the case, we may put in place certain additional terms and we will generally confirm to you the number of Authorised Users in writing or in your user account. We will also generally provide you with a set of login details for each Authorised User. Each Authorised User will be expected to adhere to these Terms when they first sign in.</p>

                            <li>We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Platform and our Services are generally available without interruption, but you acknowledge and agree that internet systems and services are not interruption, error or fault free, and we make no representation or warranty in relation to the same. You further acknowledge and agree that occasional periods of downtime for repair, maintenance and upgrade may be required and therefore uninterrupted provision of the Platform and our Services cannot be guaranteed.

                            <li>Generally, Clients have two options for finding a professional near them through our Platform. Clients can choose to search and send a direct Enquiry through the “Consult Now” functionality to their chosen professional or use our automated appointment booking service and consult with the most suitable professionals matching their criteria.</li>
                            <li>If a Client chooses to search locally for a professional using city-based search, they will be shown a list of local professionals to choose from.</li>
                            <li>Should you reject a direct Enquiry (Consult Now), then the Enquiry will be forwarded to other professionals in the local area who are currently available online and most suited to the Client's requirements (“Forward Enquiries”).</li>
                            <li>Clients choosing to book an appointment with the selected legal professional are required to fill in an enquiry form specifying their requirements and choose an appointment time using the Platform's appointment booking feature. Our booking tool then sends the Enquiry (appointment booking) direct to the inbox of the selected lawyer. This results in a “Booked Appointment”.</li>
                            <li>You acknowledge that we only pass on to lawyers and law firms the information provided by each Client and we offer no guarantee that their response to your Enquiry will be complete or accurate.</li>

In these instances, you acknowledge that we act as an intermediary or directory service. If your case is serious, you have suffered damage or harm as a result of engaging a specific lawyer, or you feel that other users of the Platform may suffer damage or harm as a result of engaging that lawyer, we recommend you report your concern to the local regulatory or professional body, such as the Solicitors Regulation Authority.</p>
